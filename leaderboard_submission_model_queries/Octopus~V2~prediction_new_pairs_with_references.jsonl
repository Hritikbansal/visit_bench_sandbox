Curious, he picked it up and examined it. It was unlike any cup he had ever seen before - it was enormous, almost comically so.\n\nAs Jack held the cup, he couldn't help but think of the mysterious woman he had seen in a photograph at the local coffee shop. She was a White woman with wild, staring wide-eyes and shoulder-length hair. In the photo, she was holding a cup just like the one he now held in his hands. The image of her had captivated him, and he couldn't shake the feeling that their paths were meant to cross.\n\nDetermined to find the woman from the photograph, Jack decided to carry the large white paper cup with him everywhere he went.

People in the town began to notice and whisper about the strange man with the enormous cup. Some even started calling him \"Cup Jack.\" But Jack didn't care; he knew that he was on a mission to find the woman of his dreams.\n\nOne sunny afternoon, as Jack was sitting in the park with his cup, he noticed a woman walking towards him. She had shoulder-length hair and a familiar wild, wide-eyed stare. As she approached, Jack's heart began to race. Could this be her?\n\nThe woman walked up to Jack and looked at the large white paper cup in his hands. She smiled and said, \"I've been looking for that cup everywhere! I lost it a few weeks ago, and I never thought I'd see it again.\"\n\nJack couldn't believe his luck. He had finally found the woman from the photograph. He handed her the cup and said, \"I've been carrying this cup around, hoping to find you. I saw your picture in the coffee shop, and I knew I had to meet you.\"\n\nThe woman, whose name was Emily, was touched by Jack's determination and kind heart. The two of them sat in the park, talking and laughing for hours. They discovered that they had a lot in common and felt an instant connection.\n\nFrom that day on, Jack and Emily were inseparable.

Using the equations above, we can find the polar equation of the circle.\n\nThe center of the circle is at (1,2)\nThe radius of the circle is 4\nSo, the polar equation of the circle is given as:\n\nx = (1 cos \u03b8 + 2 sin \u03b8) / 4\ny = (1 sin \u03b8 - 2 cos \u03b8) / 4\n\nUsing this equation, we can find the position of the point (4, -2) on the circle.\n\nx = (1 cos \u03b8 + 2 sin \u03b8) / 4\n= (1*-1 + 2*1) / 4\n= -1/-2\n\ny = (1 sin \u03b8 - 2 cos \u03b8) / 4\n= (1*1", "A_model": "Octopus V2 prediction", "B_model": "MiniGPT-4 prediction", "reference": "To find the polar equation of the conic with the given conditions, we can use the formula:\n\nr = (ed) / (1 + e * cos(\u03b8))\n\nwhere r is the distance from the origin to a point on the conic, e is the eccentricity, d is the distance from the focus to the directrix, and \u03b8 is the angle between the polar axis and the line connecting the origin to the point on the conic.\n\nSince the focus is at the origin and the directrix is x = 3, the distance from the focus to the directrix (d) is 3 units. The eccentricity (e) is given as 2.\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nr = (2 * 3) / (1 + 2 * cos(\u03b8))\nr = 6 / (1 + 2 * cos(\u03b8))\n\nSo, the polar equation of the conic is:\n\nr = 6 / (1 + 2 * cos(\u03b8))", "image_dense_caption": "This image has a piece of paper with a handwritten mathematical problem written on it.

It absorbs light energy from the sun and uses it to make sugars from carbon dioxide and water.  When the days get shorter and the nights get longer, the amount of light energy that the leaves receive decreases.  This causes the leaves on the deciduous trees to change color.  The green chloroplasts are replaced by orange and red pigments called carotenoids and anthocyanins.  The carotinoids are yellow and orange and the anthocynanins are red and purple.  The leaves are no longer able to use the light energy to make sugar, so they die and fall off the tree.  This process is called senescence.  This is the process of the leaves changing color and falling off the trees in the fall.  The process of leaves changing colors and falling from the trees is called autumn.  The word autumn comes from the Latin autumnus, which means \u201cfalling leaves. \u201d The leaves change color because the days are getting shorter and there is less light energy for the chlorophyl to use to make food for the trees.

Point A is located at (a^1, a^2) and point B is located at (b^1, b^2).\n\nNext, we form a right triangle by connecting points A and B with a diagonal line (the hypotenuse) and drawing two perpendicular lines from point A to the x-axis and from point B to the x-axis. The length of the horizontal side of the triangle is given by the difference in the x-coordinates, which is (b^1 - a^1).

Next, I drew a line through the points, which is a straight line.

The length of the horizontal side of the triangle is given by the difference in the x-coordinates, which is (b^1 - a^1). The length of the vertical side of the triangle is given by the difference in the y-coordinates, which is (b^2 - a^2).\n\nNow, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the distance between points A and B (the length of the hypotenuse). The Pythagorean theorem states that the square of the length of the hypotenuse (d(A, B)^2) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides.\n\nSo, d(A, B)^2 = (b^1 - a^1)^2 + (b^2 - a^2)^2.\n\nTo find the distance d(A, B), we take the square root of both sides:\n\nd(A, B) = \u221a((b^1 - a^1)^2 + (b^2 - a^2)^2).\n\nThis is the Distance Formula, which gives the distance between two points in a two-dimensional coordinate system.

Time had taken its toll on the machinery, but the gears remained, eager to be set in motion once more.\n\nThe largest gear, known as Big Ben, was the leader of the group. With its impressive size and strength, it had the power to set the entire machine in motion. Big Ben was connected to a smaller gear, named Little Tim, who was always eager to prove his worth. Little Tim's enthusiasm was contagious, and he was well-liked by the other gears.\n\nTo the left of Little Tim was another gear of the same size, named Sally. Sally was a bit shy, but she was always willing to lend a helping hand when needed. She was connected to Little Tim, and together, they formed a strong bond that kept the machine running smoothly.\n\nAbove Little Tim and Sally was a gear named Bolt, who was known for his unwavering stability. Bolt had a giant bolt in the center, which held him firmly in place. He was connected to Little Tim at a 45-degree angle, and his steadfast nature provided a sense of security for the other gears.\n\nTo the left of Sally was a gear named Pin, who was connected to a gear directly below him, named Penny. Pin and Penny were inseparable, and their connection was vital to the machine's overall function. Pin had a pin in the center, while Penny was only partially visible, peeking out from the bottom left corner of the image.\n\nOne day, a curious inventor stumbled upon the workshop and marveled at the intricate connections between the gears. Inspired by their unity, he decided to restore the machine to its former glory. As he carefully cleaned and oiled each gear, the connections between them grew stronger, and the gears began to move in perfect harmony.\n\nAs the gears turned, the once-forgotten workshop came to life, filled with the sounds of whirring and clanking.

To make the look more dramatic, you can also use a white liner to create a cat-eye shape on the outer corners of the eyes.  This look can also be achieved with a liquid liner, but it will be more difficult to create the winged shape.  To create this look, you will need a black liner and a white powder.  The first step is to apply the black lining to the upper and lower lash lines.  Next, use the powder to fill in between the lining and your lashes.  This is a great way to make your eyes look bigger and brighter.  To achieve a smoky eye, you need to use a dark brown or black eye shadow.
