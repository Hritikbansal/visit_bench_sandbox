The device is called a Zincra.  It\u2019s made by a company in Germany.  It has a magnet on one end and a metal plate on the other end.  The metal plate has a hole in the center.  The magnet is attached to the back of a picture.  When you hang the picture on the metal plate, the magnet and the hole will line up.  The center of your picture will then be in the middle of the hole.  You can also use the device to hang pictures on a wall that\u2019s not perfectly straight.  You just have to adjust the position of the magnet on the picture so that it lines up with the hole when the picture is hanging on a crooked wall.

Alex spent hours brainstorming ideas, researching the topic, and outlining the structure of their essay. They gathered information on the positive and negative effects of technology on society and organized their thoughts into a clear and concise outline.\n\nNext came the writing stage.

Alex read through their essay multiple times, making sure that their arguments were clear and well-supported. They also checked for any inconsistencies or gaps in their logic. During this stage, Alex realized that they needed to add more information about the negative effects of technology on society. They went back to the prewriting stage to gather more research and then incorporated it into their essay.\n\nAfter revising, Alex moved on to the rewriting stage. They focused on improving the flow and clarity of their essay, making sure that each paragraph transitioned smoothly into the next. They also worked on refining their word choice and sentence structure to make their essay more engaging and easier to read.\n\nOnce Alex was satisfied with their rewritten essay, they proceeded to the proofreading stage. They meticulously checked for any spelling, grammar, or punctuation errors. Alex also asked a friend to read through their essay and provide feedback on any mistakes they might have missed.\n\nFinally, it was time for the last step: publishing. Alex submitted their polished essay to their English professor, feeling confident in the work they had put into following the writing process steps. As they waited for their grade, Alex reflected on their experience and realized that going through each stage of the writing process had truly helped them create a well-crafted and thoughtful essay.\n\nIn the end, Alex received an A on their essay and felt a sense of accomplishment.
