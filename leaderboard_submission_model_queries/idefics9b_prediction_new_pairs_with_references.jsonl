Find the focal point of the comic by drawing a circle around it, then finding the center of that circle.\n2. Find the origin of the comic by drawing a line from the focal point to a point on the circle's circumference.\n3. Calculate the eccentricity of the comic by dividing the distance between the focal point and the origin by the sum of the distances between the two points. In other words, eccentricity = (distance between the focal point and the origin) / (distance between the focal point and the circumference).\n4.

In this case, we have two points A(1, 2) and B(3, 4). We can plot these points by hand or use a graphing calculator.\n\nNext, we need to find the distance between the two points. The distance between two points is the length of the line segment that connects them. In this case, the line segment AB has a length of 5 units.\n\nTo find the distance formula, we need to find a formula that gives us the distance between two points on a line. We can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the distance formula. The Pythagorean theorem states that the square of the length of the hypotenuse of a right triangle is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides.\n\nIn a right triangle, the length of the hypotenuse is the distance between the two points.

The difference between x1 and x2 is 1, and the difference in y1 and y2 is also 1.  The square root of 12 is approximately 3. 16, so the distance is 3 1/2 units.  The distance formula can also be used to find the length of a line segment.  The length of the line segment between the points (1, 2) and (-1, -2) can be found by using the distance formula.  The first step is to plot the points on a coordinate plane.  Next, we find the differences in the x and y coordinates of the points.

The length of the horizontal side of the triangle is given by the difference in the x-coordinates, which is (b^1 - a^1). The length of the vertical side of the triangle is given by the difference in the y-coordinates, which is (b^2 - a^2).\n\nNow, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the distance between points A and B (the length of the hypotenuse). The Pythagorean theorem states that the square of the length of the hypotenuse (d(A, B)^2) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides.\n\nSo, d(A, B)^2 = (b^1 - a^1)^2 + (b^2 - a^2)^2.\n\nTo find the distance d(A, B), we take the square root of both sides:\n\nd(A, B) = \u221a((b^1 - a^1)^2 + (b^2 - a^2)^2).\n\nThis is the Distance Formula, which gives the distance between two points in a two-dimensional coordinate system.
