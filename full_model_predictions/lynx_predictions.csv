what is the i'm term in the geometric sequence?

the first term of the sequence can be written as a(n-1), where n represents the number of terms. in this case, n=10, so we have:
a(0) = 0 (since there is no previous term to use as the starting point)
then, we can use the formula for geometric progression to find the value of each term: 
an = (a0 * r^n) / r
where r = the common ratio between consecutive terms, and n is equal to the difference between the current term and the previous one (n = a1 - a0).
for the given sequence, the first two terms are already known, which means we only need to calculate the values for the remaining terms (1-9). here's how to do it:"

to derive the formula, we can use the pythagorean theorem, which states that the square of half the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of squares of two other sides. this can be written as:
d = sqrt((a*a) + (b*b))
we can simplify this equation by rearranging the terms and squaring both sides to get the following equation:  
(d*d) = (a * a)^(1/2)*(b * b)
this equation can then be solved for d by taking the natural logarithm (ln) of each side and substituting them into the equation. we get:   
ln((d * d) ) = ln(( a^ ( 1 /2 ) * ( b *  b)) ) )

In the past, scientists classified living organisms into two groups: plants and animals. Over the past 300 years, scientists have discovered many more types of organisms. Today, many scientists classify organisms into six broad groups, called kingdoms. Organisms in each kingdom have specific traits. The table below shows some traits used to describe each kingdom. | Bacteria | Archaea | Protists | Fungi | Animals | Plants How many cells do they have? | one | one | one or many | one or many | many | many Do their cells have a nucleus? | no | no | yes | yes | yes | yes Can their cells make food? | some species can | some species can | some species can | no | no | yes.

1. resistance: this stage is characterized by a lack of understanding and acceptance of change, as well as resistance from employees who may feel threatened or uncomfortable with the proposed changes. 
2. adoption: as employees become more familiar with and understand the changes, they begin to accept and adapt to the new way of doing things. they may still have questions or concerns, but they are actively participating in the implementation process.  
3. internalization: at this point, employees have fully embraced and internalized the changed processes and procedures, and are now able to apply them consistently in their daily work. there may be some residual issues or challenges that need to be addressed, such as training or support for new tools or systems.

scienceqa,868_scienceqa_9.jpg,Is dolerite a mineral or a rock?,"grade8. natural science. earth-science. Rocks and minerals. Identify rocks and minerals. Minerals are the building blocks of rocks. A rock can be made of one or more minerals. Minerals and rocks have the following properties: Property | Mineral | Rock It is a solid. | Yes | Yes It is formed in nature. | Yes | Yes It is not made by organisms. | Yes | Yes It is a pure substance. | Yes | No It has a fixed crystal structure. | Yes | No You can use these properties to tell whether a substance is a mineral, a rock, or neither. Look closely at the last three properties: Minerals and rocks are not made by organisms. Organisms make their own body parts. For example, snails and clams make their shells. Because they are made by organisms, body parts cannot be minerals or rocks. Humans are organisms too. So, substances that humans make by hand or in factories are not minerals or rocks. A mineral is a pure substance, but a rock is not. A pure substance is made of only one type of matter. Minerals are pure substances, but rocks are not. Instead, all rocks are mixtures. A mineral has a fixed crystal structure, but a rock does not. The crystal structure of a substance tells you how the atoms or molecules in the substance are arranged. Different types of minerals have different crystal structures, but all minerals have a fixed crystal structure. This means that the atoms and molecules in different pieces of the same type of mineral are always arranged the same way. However, rocks do not have a fixed crystal structure. So, the arrangement of atoms or molecules in different pieces of the same type of rock may be different! The properties of dolerite match the properties of a rock.

in addition to these basic care practices, there are a few other tips to consider when planting and maintaining a hedge of azaleas:
1. choose the right variety: different varieties have different growth habits and bloom times, so choose ones that complement each other in terms of size, color, and flowering time to create a cohesive look. 
2. space them appropriately: plant the flowers at least 18 to 24 inches apart, depending on the variety, to allow for proper air circulation and light penetration. this will also help prevent overcrowding and reduce the risk of pests and diseases."

A solution is made up of two or more substances that are completely mixed. In a solution, solute particles are mixed into a solvent. The solute cannot be separated from the solvent by a filter. For example, if you stir a spoonful of salt into a cup of water, the salt will mix into the water to make a saltwater solution. In this case, the salt is the solute. The water is the solvent. The concentration of a solute in a solution is a measure of the ratio of solute to solvent. Concentration can be described in terms of particles of solute per volume of solvent. concentration = particles of solute / volume of solvent. In Solution A and Solution B, the green particles represent the solute. To figure out which solution has a higher concentration of green particles, look at both the number of green particles and the volume of the solvent in each container.

if it was a natural disaster, such as a wildfire or lightning strike, or if it is an accidental fire, like a candle or cooking fire that got out of control, it would depend on whether the property is insured or not. in the case of an uninsured property, the first step would likely be contacting a local charity or non-profit organization that specializes in providing assistance to people who have lost their homes due to fire. 
in the event of a fire in an apartment building or multi-unit dwelling, residents would need to contact their landlord or property management company to report the incident and seek guidance on what to do next. they may also want to reach out to their neighbors to make sure everyone is safe and accounted for, as well as to offer assistance if needed."

scienceqa,861_scienceqa_2.jpg,Which of these organisms contains matter that was once part of the lichen?,"A food web is a model. A food web shows where organisms in an ecosystem get their food. Models can make things in nature easier to understand because models can represent complex things in a simpler way. If a food web showed every organism in an ecosystem, the food web would be hard to understand. So, each food web shows how some organisms in an ecosystem can get their food. Arrows show how matter moves. A food web has arrows that point from one organism to another. Each arrow shows the direction that matter moves when one organism eats another organism. An arrow starts from the organism that is eaten. The arrow points to the organism that is doing the eating. An organism in a food web can have more than one arrow pointing from it. This shows that the organism is eaten by more than one other organism in the food web. An organism in a food web can also have more than one arrow pointing to it. This shows that the organism eats more than one other organism in the food web. Use the arrows to follow how matter moves through this food web. For each answer choice, try to find a path of arrows that starts from the lichen. No arrow points to the bilberry.

to make it look more normal, water would need to be reintroduced into the area, either through rainfall or irrigation. in some cases, the dryness can be alleviated by adding organic matter, such as mulch or compost, to improve soil structure and water retention. additionally, planting native vegetation can help stabilize soil and create a more sustainable ecosystem that can better withstand drought conditions."
