Next, we need to find the distance between the two points. The distance between two points is the length of the line segment that connects them. In this case, the line segment AB has a length of 5 units.

To find the distance formula, we need to find a formula that gives us the distance between two points on a line. We can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the distance formula. The Pythagorean theorem states that the square of the length of the hypotenuse of a right triangle is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides.

In a right triangle, the length of the hypotenuse is the distance between the two points. We can use this formula to find the distance between two points on a line.

To use the Pythagorean theorem to find the distance formula, we need to plug in the values for the length of the hypotenuse"

Her action sparked a significant social change that reverberates to this day. At that time, racial segregation was a deeply rooted practice in the United States, and African Americans were often subjected to discrimination and humiliation.

Parks' decision to stay in her seat challenged the unjust laws and sparked a wave of protests and activism across the country. Her act of defiance led to the Montgomery Bus Boycott, which lasted for over a year and ultimately led to the desegregation of public transportation in Montgomery. This event marked a turning point in the Civil Rights Movement and inspired other activists to fight for racial equality and justice.

Rosa Parks' courageous decision to sit in a ""whites only"" section of a bus sparked a movement that changed the course of history and paved the way for the eventual end of racial segregation in the United States. Her legacy continues"

In general, it is better to water them less frequently but deeply, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings. This will help the cactus to develop a deep root system and prevent root rot. As for sunlight, cacti need plenty of it to grow and produce flowers. Place them in a sunny location, but be careful not to expose them to direct sunlight for too long, as this can cause sunburn. In addition, make sure the soil is well-draining and provide good air circulation around the plants."

What is the dangers and how can you remain safe?,Hazard Identification,https://visit-instruction-tuning.s3.amazonaws.com/visit_images/167_tested_skill_hazard_identification_92b230d8b0b7a1ac.png,"The dangers in this image are the presence of multiple propane tanks and a fire hydrant in a fenced-in area. The propane tanks are potentially hazardous if not handled or stored properly, as they contain flammable and potentially explosive gases. The fire hydrant, while essential for fire safety, can also pose a risk if it is damaged or malfunctioning.

To remain safe, it is important to follow proper handling and storage guidelines for propane tanks, such as ensuring they are placed on level ground, not overfilled, and kept away from heat sources or open flames. Additionally, it is crucial to maintain the fire hydrant by regularly inspecting it for damage and ensuring it is in good working condition. If you encounter any issues with the propane tanks or the fire hydrant, it is important to report them to the appropriate authorities or professionals for further assessment and repair."

However, the way they do this is different. The smaller objects, such as the birds, are able to achieve their heights through flapping their wings, which generates lift. This lift counteracts gravity and allows the birds to stay airborne.

On the other hand, the large object in the center of the image, which is a rocket, is able to achieve its height by using a combination of thrust and lift. The thrust from the rocket's engines propels it forward, and the lift is generated by the rocket's shape. The rocket's shape is designed to minimize air resistance, allowing it to achieve a higher altitude.

In summary, both the smaller objects and the large rocket are able to overcome the force of gravity and achieve their respective heights, but they do so through different mechanisms."

To solve this puzzle, you can follow these steps:

1. Look for the center of the Rubik's cube, which is usually a single block with a different color from the others.
2. Start by assigning a color to this center block.
3. Focus on one side of the Rubik's cube at a time.
4. Apply the following algorithm to each side:
   a. If the block on that side is white, move it to the center.
   b. If the block on that side is blue, move it to the center.
   c. If the block on that side is green, move it to the center.
   d. If the block on that side is red, move it to the center.
5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 for the remaining sides of the Rubik's cube.
6. Once all sides are completed, the cube should be solved.

Note that the actual algorithm for solving a Rubik's cube involves more steps and variations, but this general approach should help you get started."

Life vests are a crucial safety feature for swimmers, especially children, as they provide buoyancy and support in the water. They help to keep the wearer afloat and prevent drowning.

Life vests come in various designs and sizes, and they are made from materials that provide different levels of buoyancy and flexibility. Some life vests are inflatable, while others are made from foam or other lightweight materials. The life vest in the image is an inflatable one, which the boy can wear by putting it on and then inflating it with a hand pump or mouthpiece.

Once the life vest is inflated, it provides a layer of cushioning and support for the wearer, helping them to stay afloat and breathe more easily. This is especially important for children, who may not have the strength or swimming skills to stay afloat on their own.
