Solving Geometry Problems,https://visit-instruction-tuning.s3.amazonaws.com/visit_images/293_tested_skill_solving_geometry_problems_423px-01-Abstand_zweier_Punkte.svg.png,"Derive the Distance Formula, and explain the steps that you took to reach your answer, beginning with the plotting of the two points shown on this graph.","To derive the Distance Formula, we start by plotting the two points A and B on the graph as described in the image. Point A is located at (a^1, a^2) and point B is located at (b^1, b^2).

Next, we form a right triangle by connecting points A and B with a diagonal line (the hypotenuse) and drawing two perpendicular lines from point A to the x-axis and from point B to the x-axis. The length of the horizontal side of the triangle is given by the difference in the x-coordinates, which is (b^1 - a^1). The length of the vertical side of the triangle is given by the difference in the y-coordinates, which is (b^2 - a^2).

Now, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the distance between points A and B (the length of the hypotenuse). The Pythagorean theorem states that the square of the length of the hypotenuse (d(A, B)^2) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides.

So, d(A, B)^2 = (b^1 - a^1)^2 + (b^2 - a^2)^2.

To find the distance d(A, B), we take the square root of both sides:

d(A, B) = √((b^1 - a^1)^2 + (b^2 - a^2)^2).

This is the Distance Formula, which gives the distance between two points in a two-dimensional coordinate system. The steps we took to derive this formula involved plotting the points, forming a right triangle, and applying the Pythagorean theorem.","The image shows a graph with the following information in it:Along the x-axis there are labels marked a^1 and then further along another label marked b^1, followed by an x symbol with an arrow directly above it.Along the y axis there are labels marked a^2 then further up there is a label marked b^2 and above this there is a label marked y with an arrow pointing upwards from it.There is also a triangle marked out within the graph. The point A is marked in blue with a circle and is located at (a^2, a^1). There are dotted lines showing this.

Since the focus is at the origin and the directrix is x = 3, the distance from the focus to the directrix (d) is 3 units. The eccentricity (e) is given as 2.

Now, we can plug these values into the formula:

Write a Story,https://visit-instruction-tuning.s3.amazonaws.com/visit_images/212_tested_skill_write_a_story_59c5603789d2a764.png,Write a short story about a student writing an essay and their experiences going through each of the stages shown in the image.,"Once upon a time, in a small college town, there was a student named Alex who was assigned to write an essay for their English class. The essay topic was ""The Impact of Technology on Society."" Alex was determined to write the best essay they had ever written and decided to follow the writing process steps depicted in a flow-chart they found online.

The first step was prewriting. Alex spent hours brainstorming ideas, researching the topic, and outlining the structure of their essay. They gathered information on the positive and negative effects of technology on society and organized their thoughts into a clear and concise outline.

Next came the writing stage. Alex began to transform their outline into a well-structured essay. They carefully crafted an engaging introduction, followed by strong arguments supported by evidence, and concluded with a thought-provoking conclusion. Alex felt confident about their essay and was excited to move on to the next step.

The third step was revising. Alex read through their essay multiple times, making sure that their arguments were clear and well-supported. They also checked for any inconsistencies or gaps in their logic. During this stage, Alex realized that they needed to add more information about the negative effects of technology on society. They went back to the prewriting stage to gather more research and then incorporated it into their essay.

After revising, Alex moved on to the rewriting stage. They focused on improving the flow and clarity of their essay, making sure that each paragraph transitioned smoothly into the next. They also worked on refining their word choice and sentence structure to make their essay more engaging and easier to read.

Once Alex was satisfied with their rewritten essay, they proceeded to the proofreading stage. They meticulously checked for any spelling, grammar, or punctuation errors. Alex also asked a friend to read through their essay and provide feedback on any mistakes they might have missed.

Finally, it was time for the last step: publishing. Alex submitted their polished essay to their English professor, feeling confident in the work they had put into following the writing process steps. As they waited for their grade, Alex reflected on their experience and realized that going through each stage of the writing process had truly helped them create a well-crafted and thoughtful essay.

In the end, Alex received an A on their essay and felt a sense of accomplishment. They learned the importance of following the writing process and knew that they would continue to use these steps in their future writing endeavors. And so, Alex's journey through the writing process not only led to a successful essay but also to a valuable lesson in the art of writing.","The image depicts a flow-chart describing the the steps of the writing process and they go as follows; Prewriting, to writing, to revise, to rewrite, to proofread, to publish.

They knew they had to write an essay, but they weren't sure where to start. Taking a deep breath, they looked at the image of the writing process that they had been given. It showed the different stages of writing an essay, from brainstorming to proofreading.

The student began by brainstorming ideas, jotting down anything that came to mind. After they had a few ideas, they started to organize them into an outline. Once the outline was complete, they began to write the essay. As they wrote, they kept referring back to the image to make sure they were following the correct steps.

When the essay was finished, the student went through the editing and proofreading stages. They read through the essay multiple times, making sure that all the grammar and spelling was correct. Finally, they were satisfied with the essay and submitted it.

The student was relieved to have finished the essay, and they were proud of the work they had done. They had followed the writing process step by step, and it had paid off."

The angle sum property states that the sum of the angles in a triangle is always 180 degrees. 

First, we can find angle A by using the angle sum property for triangle ACD:
Angle A = 180 - (20 + 60) = 180 - 80 = 100 degrees.

Next, we can find angle E by using the angle sum property for triangle ABE:
Angle E = 180 - (100 + 30) = 180 - 130 = 50 degrees.

Now, we can find angle D by using the angle sum property for triangle BCD:
Angle D = 180 - (60 + 50) = 180 - 110 = 70 degrees.

Finally, we can find the value of 'x' by using the angle sum property for triangle DEB:
x = 180 - (70 + 50) = 180 - 120 = 60 degrees.

So, the value of 'x' for this triangle is 60 degrees.",This is a triangle with sides ADB ; BC ; AEC. It contains lines BFE ; CFD ; DE. The known angles are ACD (20) ; BCD (60) ; EBC (50) ; ABE (30).

He was known for his exceptional skills in swordsmanship and his unwavering loyalty to his clan. Takeshi's most prized possession was his sword, a magnificent katana named ""Kusanagi.""

Kusanagi was no ordinary sword. It was forged by the legendary swordsmith, Masamune, and was said to possess the spirit of a powerful dragon. The sword had been passed down through generations of samurai in Takeshi's family, and it was now his turn to wield it.

Takeshi and Kusanagi were inseparable. The sword was not only a symbol of his family's honor but also a constant reminder of the responsibility he bore as a samurai. Takeshi spent countless hours practicing with Kusanagi, honing his skills and learning to harness the power of the dragon within the blade.

One day, Takeshi's village was attacked by a rival clan. The invaders were ruthless, burning homes and slaughtering innocent villagers. Takeshi, armed with Kusanagi, fought valiantly to protect his people. As he slashed through the enemy ranks, the dragon's spirit within the sword seemed to come alive, its flames engulfing the blade and incinerating all who dared to stand in Takeshi's path.

The battle raged on for hours, but eventually, the invaders were defeated, and peace was restored to the village. Takeshi's bravery and skill with Kusanagi had saved his people, and he was hailed as a hero.

As the years went by, Takeshi continued to serve his clan with honor and distinction. He and Kusanagi became legends in their own right, their names whispered in awe by those who had witnessed their prowess in battle.

But as with all things, time eventually took its toll on Takeshi. His once-youthful body grew old and weary, and he knew that his days as a samurai were coming to an end. With a heavy heart, he decided to pass Kusanagi on to the next generation.

Takeshi's son, Kenji, was a promising young warrior who had been training under his father's watchful eye. As Takeshi handed Kusanagi to Kenji, he could see the same fire in his son's eyes that had burned within him all those years ago.

With a mixture of pride and sadness, Takeshi watched as Kenji took up Kusanagi and continued the legacy of their family.

These gears, each with their own unique characteristics, were part of a grand machine that had once been the heart of the factory. Time had taken its toll on the machinery, but the gears remained, eager to be set in motion once more.

The largest gear, known as Big Ben, was the leader of the group. With its impressive size and strength, it had the power to set the entire machine in motion. Big Ben was connected to a smaller gear, named Little Tim, who was always eager to prove his worth. Little Tim's enthusiasm was contagious, and he was well-liked by the other gears.

To the left of Little Tim was another gear of the same size, named Sally. Sally was a bit shy, but she was always willing to lend a helping hand when needed. She was connected to Little Tim, and together, they formed a strong bond that kept the machine running smoothly.

Above Little Tim and Sally was a gear named Bolt, who was known for his unwavering stability. Bolt had a giant bolt in the center, which held him firmly in place. He was connected to Little Tim at a 45-degree angle, and his steadfast nature provided a sense of security for the other gears.

To the left of Sally was a gear named Pin, who was connected to a gear directly below him, named Penny. Pin and Penny were inseparable, and their connection was vital to the machine's overall function. Pin had a pin in the center, while Penny was only partially visible, peeking out from the bottom left corner of the image.

One day, a curious inventor stumbled upon the workshop and marveled at the intricate connections between the gears. Inspired by their unity, he decided to restore the machine to its former glory. As he carefully cleaned and oiled each gear, the connections between them grew stronger, and the gears began to move in perfect harmony.

As the gears turned, the once-forgotten workshop came to life, filled with the sounds of whirring and clanking. The gears, now working together as a cohesive unit, were overjoyed to be set in motion once more. Their connections, forged through years of teamwork and friendship, allowed the grand machine to run smoothly and efficiently, a testament to the power of unity and collaboration.","It is a vintage photo of metal gears attached to some type of machinery.

4. Fold the bottom edge of the paper up, so it covers the bottom portion of the triangle. Crease the fold and flip the paper over.
5. Repeat step 4 on the other side, folding the bottom edge up to cover the triangle. You should now have a diamond shape.
6. Fold the bottom corners of the diamond inward, so they meet at the center crease. This will create a smaller diamond shape.
7. Fold the bottom point of the smaller diamond up, so it meets the top point. Crease the fold and flip the paper over.
8. Repeat step 7 on the other side, folding the bottom point up to meet the top point. You should now have a triangle shape.
9. Hold the triangle by the bottom corners and gently pull them apart, allowing the paper to open up into a boat shape.

Lily searched far and wide for her lost wings, but they were nowhere to be found. The other fairies in the forest tried to help her, but without her wings, Lily felt incomplete and lost. She could no longer fly with her friends or explore the vast skies above the forest.

As the days turned into weeks, and the weeks into months, Lily's spirit began to fade. She spent her days sitting alone, gazing up at the sky, longing for the freedom she once had. Her friends tried to cheer her up, but the sadness in her heart was too great.

One day, as Lily sat by the edge of a pond, she saw her reflection in the water. The once vibrant and joyful fairy was now a shadow of her former self. Her eyes filled with tears as she realized that she would never fly again.

In her despair, Lily made a decision. She would leave the magical forest and venture into the unknown world beyond, hoping to find a new purpose in life. With a heavy heart, she said goodbye to her friends and set off on her journey.

As the years passed, Lily's friends never forgot her. They would often gather at the edge of the forest, gazing into the distance, hoping to catch a glimpse of their lost friend. But Lily never returned, and the magical forest was never the same without her.

And so, the story of Lily the fairy ends with a heavy heart and a longing for the life she once knew. The memory of her beautiful white wings and the joy she brought to the magical forest will forever remain in the hearts of those who knew her.",There is a fairy with white wings on her back.

Start with the elemental that is aligned with the image.","In a distant future, Earth had become a lush, green utopia. The air was clean, and the environment was thriving. It was in this world that the Elemental Bubbles appeared.

One day, while walking through a dense forest, a young scientist named Elara stumbled upon a peculiar sight. A floating soap bubble, reflecting purple and yellow light, hovered in the air. The background was a blurry green environment, and the bubble seemed to be pulsating with energy. Intrigued, Elara reached out to touch it, but as her fingers brushed the surface, the bubble burst, releasing a torrent of water.

From the water emerged a majestic creature, a Water Nymph, with shimmering blue skin and hair that flowed like a river. The nymph smiled at Elara and whispered, ""Thank you for releasing me. I am a guardian of the element of water, and I have been trapped in that bubble for centuries.""

Word of Elara's discovery spread, and soon, people all over the world were finding Elemental Bubbles. Each bubble contained a mythical creature aligned with one of the four elements: earth, water, wind, and fire. As the bubbles were burst, the creatures emerged, bringing with them the power of their respective elements.

The Earth Golems, with their bodies made of stone and soil, helped cultivate the land and build great structures. The Water Nymphs purified the oceans and rivers, ensuring that all living beings had access to clean water. The Wind Sprites danced through the skies, controlling the weather and ensuring that the planet's climate remained stable. And the Fire Salamanders, with their bodies wreathed in flame, provided warmth and light in the darkest corners of the world.

As the Elemental creatures worked together, the world became even more prosperous and harmonious. The people of Earth learned to harness the power of the elements, using them to create new technologies and improve their lives. And Elara, the young scientist who had discovered the first Elemental Bubble, became a renowned figure, leading the research into these mythical beings and their incredible powers.

But as with all great discoveries, there were those who sought to exploit the Elemental creatures for their own gain. A shadowy organization, known as the Order of the Void, sought to capture the creatures and use their powers to control the world. They believed that by harnessing the power of the elements, they could bend the world to their will and create a new order, with themselves at the top.

Elara and her allies, a group of scientists, environmentalists, and Elemental creatures, banded together to stop the Order of the Void. They fought to protect the Elemental creatures and ensure that their powers were used for the good of all, not just the few.

In the end, the forces of good triumphed, and the Order of the Void was defeated. The Elemental creatures continued to work alongside humanity, using their powers to maintain the balance of the world and ensure that Earth remained a green utopia for generations to come.

And as for Elara, she continued her research, studying the Elemental creatures and their incredible powers.

Years passed, and the villagers spoke of a miracle that occurred in the village graveyard. John, who had been buried there, was given a second chance at life by a benevolent spirit. He had to dig himself out of his grave to reunite with his son. As he emerged from the ground, his hands were covered in dirt, but his heart was filled with love and gratitude.

Timmy, now a teenager, was playing in the fields when he saw his father approaching. At first, he couldn't believe his eyes, but as John came closer, Timmy recognized the familiar warmth in his father's eyes. They reached out to each other, and as their hands touched, the dirt from John's hands transferred to Timmy's fingertips.

In that moment, the bond between father and son was rekindled, and the entire village rejoiced at the miraculous reunion. John's return brought hope and happiness to the villagers, who now believed in the power of love and the possibility of miracles. The story of John and Timmy became a legend, inspiring generations to cherish their loved ones and never lose hope in the face of adversity.",There are two hands that are touching each other.

She was known for her grace and beauty, especially when she danced. Lily had a favorite color, which was yellow, as it reminded her of the warm sun that brightened her days. Her mother, who was a skilled seamstress, had made her a beautiful yellow dress that flowed like the rays of the sun when she danced.

One day, while practicing her ballet routine in the village square, Lily noticed a frail old woman sitting on a bench, watching her intently. The old woman had a kind smile and eyes that sparkled with wisdom. After finishing her dance, Lily approached the woman and asked if she needed any help.

The old woman introduced herself as Granny Rose and told Lily that she was once a great dancer in her youth. She had traveled the world, performing for kings and queens, but now she was old and tired. Granny Rose had returned to her hometown to live out her final days.

Lily felt a deep connection with Granny Rose and decided to visit her every day, listening to her stories and learning from her wisdom. One day, Granny Rose told Lily about a magical flower that bloomed only once every hundred years. This flower had the power to grant a single wish to the person who presented it to someone they truly cared for.

Inspired by the story, Lily set out on a quest to find the magical flower. She searched high and low, through forests and mountains, until she finally found it hidden in a secret garden. The flower was as beautiful as Granny Rose had described, with delicate pink petals and a vibrant green stem.

With the magical flower in hand, Lily returned to the village and went straight to Granny Rose's house. She stood on one leg, her other in the air behind her, wearing her yellow dress and pink ballet shoes. With both arms stretched out, she clasped the flower and presented it to Granny Rose.

Granny Rose was deeply touched by Lily's gesture and knew that the young girl had found the magical flower. With tears in her eyes, she wished for Lily to have a life filled with love, happiness, and endless opportunities to share her gift of dance with the world.

As the years went by, Lily's fame as a dancer grew, and she traveled the world just as Granny Rose had done. She always wore her yellow dress, a symbol of the love and bond she shared with her mother and Granny Rose. And with each performance, Lily brought joy and happiness to everyone who watched her dance, just as the magical flower had granted her.","This is an artistic illustration of a purple frame around an inner white border and slightly pink background.

As the race began, Bella quickly hopped far ahead of Timmy, leaving him far behind. Feeling confident in her lead, Bella decided to take a quick nap under a shady tree. She closed her eyes and drifted off to sleep, dreaming of her victory.

Meanwhile, Timmy continued to move slowly and steadily along the road. He never gave up, even when the sun was hot and the road seemed endless. As he passed by the sleeping Bella, he smiled, knowing that sometimes slow and steady wins the race.

Eventually, Timmy reached the end of the road and waited for Bella to arrive. When Bella finally woke up and realized what had happened, she hopped as fast as she could to catch up with Timmy. But it was too late; Timmy had already won the race.

Bella congratulated Timmy on his victory and learned an important lesson that day: it's not always about being the fastest, but about being consistent and never giving up.

The story should include the item held by the person as well.,"Once upon a time in a small town, there lived a young man named Jack. Jack was a tall, dark-haired man with a calm and gentle demeanor. He was known for his warm smile and kind eyes, which seemed to put everyone at ease.

One day, Jack was walking through the town square when he noticed a large white paper cup sitting on a bench. Curious, he picked it up and examined it. It was unlike any cup he had ever seen before - it was enormous, almost comically so.

As Jack held the cup, he couldn't help but think of the mysterious woman he had seen in a photograph at the local coffee shop. She was a White woman with wild, staring wide-eyes and shoulder-length hair. In the photo, she was holding a cup just like the one he now held in his hands. The image of her had captivated him, and he couldn't shake the feeling that their paths were meant to cross.

Determined to find the woman from the photograph, Jack decided to carry the large white paper cup with him everywhere he went. He hoped that by doing so, he would somehow attract her attention and bring her into his life.

Days turned into weeks, and Jack continued to carry the cup with him. People in the town began to notice and whisper about the strange man with the enormous cup. Some even started calling him ""Cup Jack."" But Jack didn't care; he knew that he was on a mission to find the woman of his dreams.

One sunny afternoon, as Jack was sitting in the park with his cup, he noticed a woman walking towards him. She had shoulder-length hair and a familiar wild, wide-eyed stare. As she approached, Jack's heart began to race. Could this be her?

The woman walked up to Jack and looked at the large white paper cup in his hands. She smiled and said, ""I've been looking for that cup everywhere! I lost it a few weeks ago, and I never thought I'd see it again.""

Jack couldn't believe his luck. He had finally found the woman from the photograph. He handed her the cup and said, ""I've been carrying this cup around, hoping to find you. I saw your picture in the coffee shop, and I knew I had to meet you.""

The woman, whose name was Emily, was touched by Jack's determination and kind heart. The two of them sat in the park, talking and laughing for hours. They discovered that they had a lot in common and felt an instant connection.

From that day on, Jack and Emily were inseparable. They fell in love and eventually got married, always remembering the large white paper cup that had brought them together. And so, the story of Cup Jack and his mysterious woman had a happy ending, proving that sometimes, even the most unusual circumstances can lead to the most beautiful love stories.","This is a black and white photo of a White woman holding a large white paper cup.
