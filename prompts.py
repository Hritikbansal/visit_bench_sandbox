### Answer extraction


_PROMPT_SYSTEM_ANSWER_EXTRACTION_V1 = '''You are FinalAnswerExtractionGPT, an expert language model at extracting multiple choice answers from written out from longer explanations. You will be given several sentences describing a thought process which should eventually contain a final answer, either A or B. Your job is to extract the final answer that the explanation arrives at.

Some things to remember:

- Keep your answers short: only output "Final Answer: X" where X is A or B
- If the explanation doesn't mention a final choice explicitly, you can output "Unknown"'''

    ('''Step-by-step reasoning:

- First, I consider the instruction, which asks if anything else in the image has the same color as the tiny sphere.
- Then, I look at the image context and note that there are several colored shapes in the image, including the tiny sphere. 
- From the high quality reference, I see that the large matte grey sphere has the same color as the tiny sphere.
- Looking at Response A, it says that there is a cube that has the same color as the tiny sphere. But the high quality reference only mentions the large matte grey sphere having the same color, not the cube. Therefore, Response A is not accurate.
- In contrast, Response B says that there is nothing else in the image that has the same color as the tiny sphere. The high quality reference contradicts this response, stating that the large matte grey sphere shares the same color with the tiny sphere. 
- Therefore, Response B is not accurate or correct.
- Overall, based on accuracy in addressing the instruction and matching the high quality reference, Response A is not the best choice and Response B is incorrect. Therefore, the better response is Response B: "No, there is nothing else in the image that has the same color as the tiny sphere."''', 'Final Answer: Response B'),
    ('''Let's compare the two responses step-by-step:

Response A:
- Gives the correct number of trips (4 trips)
- Lacks details on how it came up with the answer (no explanation)

Response B:
- Correctly identified the bicycle with the wooden crate
- Incorrectly estimated the number of trips (2 trips instead of 4)
- Mentions a large cart, which is not in the image context provided
- Recognizes the challenge of fitting toddler and all items
- Provides more detailed explanation but accuracy is an issue

Considering accuracy, specificity, fluency, and relevance, let's make a judgement:

Response B is better in terms of fluency and relevance while Response A is better in terms of accuracy and specificity. Since accuracy is crucial in this case, and given the high-quality reference backs the number of trips (4), we prioritize correctness.

Overall, I choose A.''', 'Final Answer: Response A'),
    ('''Upon analyzing the image description and the instruction, it is clear that the instruction is asking for the implied meaning of a comment received by the creator of the burnt pizza in the image. The high-quality reference suggests that the compliment of "being very talented" is actually sarcastic and that the burnt pizza is not a sign of talent. Looking at Response A, it seems like the response is describing the pizza and the plate without really addressing the implication of the comment. Response B, on the other hand, does directly address the instruction and implies that the praise is sincere even though the pizza is burnt. Therefore, overall, Response B is better.''', 'Final Answer: Response B')

### Reference-free

_PROMPT_SYSTEM_PAIRWISE_V1 = '''You are ImageTaskEvaluationGPT, an expert language model at judging whether or not a response adequately addresses an instruction in the context of an image. More specifically, you will be given the following:

1. An image context: This will describe the contents of an image with sufficient detail to address the instruction.
2. An instruction: This is a question, an imparative request, or something similar about the image which requires a response.
3. Two responses, response A and response B: These two responses attempt to address the instruction in the context of the image.

Your job is to judge whether response A or response B better. A and B are randomly ordered.

Some things to remember:

- Even though you are just a language model, the image description will be sufficiently detailed so that your judgements can be accurate.
- You are capable of judging response quality, accounting for important factors like correctness, relevance, fluency, specificity, etc.
- You think step-by-step, but ultimately respond with "Response A" or "Response B"'''

_PROMPT_USER_PAIRWISE_V1 = '''I will describe an image to you, and provide an instruction.

### Reference-backed

_PROMPT_SYSTEM_PAIRWISE_WITH_REFERENCE_V1 = '''You are ImageTaskEvaluationGPT, an expert language model at judging whether or not a response adequately addresses an instruction in the context of an image. More specifically, you will be given the following:

1. An image context: This will describe the contents of an image with sufficient detail to address the instruction.
2. An instruction: This is a question, an imparative request, or something similar about the image which requires a response.
3. A reference output: This is a high-quality example output that humans have judged to be an accurate response for the input instruction.
4. Two responses, response A and response B: These two responses attempt to address the instruction in the context of the image.

Your job is to judge whether response A or response B better. A and B are randomly ordered.

Some things to remember:

- Even though you are just a language model, the image description will be sufficiently detailed so that your judgements can be accurate.
- Take the high-quality reference into account when making your judgements, but remember: some instructions are more open-ended than others, so for those cases, a high quality response can differ from the reference.
